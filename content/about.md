## About

## Hi there! 
**Hello there! I am Suffian Azizan, a bioinformatician and a language enthusiast or of all things linguistics**. Welcome to my little blog, where I post thoughts or writings that were either adapted from my physical journals or typed down fresh whenever I have time. I work as a bioinformatician in cancer research but in my free time I love reading about linguistics. If you find yourself here from the outer Internet, feel free to browse around and read. 

**If you come here after having scanned a QR code I drew in one of my physical notebooks, then that particular journal/notebook is lost,** and I would really appreciate it if you can contact me at my email address (hover or click on the "mail" icon at the bottom of the page below) and help return the book to me! Thank you!
